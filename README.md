# CityHopper
Unity game for Google's Immersive Geospatial Challenge

Developed with Unity2022.3.9f1, but probably runs with 2021.3 and above. Just download the repository and load it to test it.

It is configured to play at these coordinates: 43.37090-8.39590, but you can move it to another location by changing the Geospatial Creator Anchor config in the "GameObjectsParent" GameObject. You can also change the location and combination of the obstacles to adapt it to any location.
